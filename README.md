 \# Stampede Risk Prediction Web Application

 \#\# Project Overview

 The **Stampede Risk Prediction Web Application** is a sophisticated system engineered to proactively address the critical issue of crowd safety in densely populated areas by integrating advanced computer vision techniques with **mandatory real-time data streaming powered by Fluvio**. This application is designed as a core component for monitoring and mitigating the severe risks associated with crowd stampedes.

 At its core, the project processes input media â€“ which can be a live video feed from a connected camera or an uploaded image or video file. Within this media, the application utilizes the state-of-the-art YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning model to accurately detect the presence and location of individuals. The scene is then conceptually divided into a grid, and the density of people within each grid cell is calculated.

 Based on these density calculations and configurable thresholds, the system performs a multi-level risk assessment, categorizing the potential for stampede events from 'Normal' to a critical 'CRITICAL RISK' state. This assessment is visually conveyed through dynamic overlays on the analyzed media, highlighting high-density zones with distinct colors.

 Crucially, this project's architecture is built *around* its integration with **Fluvio**. As the analysis is performed for *every* frame (in both live stream and file upload modes), detailed data about crowd density, person counts, and the determined risk status is **published in real-time to a dedicated Fluvio topic**. This makes the application not just a standalone predictor but a foundational piece of a larger data ecosystem. Fluvio integration enables seamless consumption by downstream applications, monitoring dashboards, automated alerting systems, or data analytics pipelines, facilitating decoupled processing, storage, and advanced analytics.

 This web application is designed to be a vital asset for enhancing situational awareness and supporting decision-making for security personnel, event managers, urban planners, and emergency services in a variety of crowded settings, providing both immediate visual feedback and a structured data stream for comprehensive analysis and action.

 \#\# The Critical Importance of Stampede Prediction

 Stampedes represent one of the most dangerous hazards in mass gatherings, characterized by uncontrolled crowd movement, crushing forces, and a high potential for severe injury and death. The unpredictable nature and rapid onset of stampedes make effective prevention and real-time response paramount.

 Traditional crowd monitoring methods, often reliant on human observation, struggle to keep pace with the dynamics of large or fast-changing crowds. Factors such as limited visibility, fatigue, and the sheer volume of people can make it difficult to accurately assess density and identify escalating risks in a timely manner.

 This Stampede Risk Prediction system provides a crucial technological advantage by:

 \* **Providing Quantitative Data:** Moving beyond subjective estimates, the application provides concrete, grid-based density metrics.
 \* **Automating Risk Detection:** The AI-powered analysis automatically identifies potential problem areas based on objective thresholds, reducing reliance on manual vigilance alone.
 \* **Enabling Proactive Measures:** Early identification of increasing density allows authorities to implement preventative measures, such as rerouting crowd flow, opening new exits, or deploying additional personnel, before a critical situation develops.
 \* **Supporting Real-time Situational Awareness:** The live feed analysis and SSE updates provide continuous, actionable information to monitoring centers.
 \* **Facilitating Post-Event Analysis:** Data streamed to Fluvio is immediately available to be archived and analyzed to understand contributing factors, improve future event planning, and refine crowd management strategies.
 \* **Integration with Broader Safety Systems:** **The Fluvio integration is fundamental** for allowing the crowd data to be seamlessly incorporated into larger security and emergency response frameworks, making the prediction data accessible and actionable by other systems.

 By implementing technology like this, stakeholders can significantly improve crowd safety protocols, enhance emergency preparedness, and ultimately safeguard lives in environments prone to overcrowding.

 \#\# Key Features Explained

 \* **AI-Powered Person Detection:**
  Uses the efficient **YOLO** model (specifically `yolo11n.pt` by default, but configurable to other YOLO versions supported by the `ultralytics` library).
  Processes video frames or images to locate and identify every individual present.
  Configurable `DETECTION_THRESHOLD` allows tuning the sensitivity of the detection process.

 \* **Configurable Grid Density Analysis:**
  The analyzed frame is overlaid with an invisible grid of configurable dimensions (`GRID_ROWS` x `GRID_COLS`, defaults to 8x8).
  For each detected person, their location is mapped to a specific grid cell.
  A count is maintained for the number of people detected within each individual cell, creating a density map of the scene.

 \* **Multi-Level Risk Assessment:**
  Analyzes the populated density grid against predefined thresholds:
  `HIGH_DENSITY_THRESHOLD`: Minimum people in a grid cell to be considered 'high density'.
  `CRITICAL_DENSITY_THRESHOLD`: Minimum people in a grid cell to be considered 'critical density'.
  Assesses the overall scene risk based on the *number* of cells that exceed these thresholds:
  `HIGH_DENSITY_CELL_COUNT_THRESHOLD`: Number of high-density cells that trigger a 'High Density Warning' overall status.
  `CRITICAL_DENSITY_CELL_COUNT_THRESHOLD`: Number of critical-density cells that trigger a 'CRITICAL RISK' overall status.
  Determines and reports an overall status (e.g., "Normal", "High Density Warning", "CRITICAL RISK").

 \* **Dynamic Visual Overlays:**
  On the processed output (live feed frame or processed media), grid cells that meet the high-density or critical-density criteria are visually highlighted.
  High-density cells are typically marked with an orange overlay, while critical-density cells are marked with a more alarming red overlay.
  This provides immediate visual cues to the user or monitoring personnel about the location of potential problem zones.

 \* **Real-time Live Stream Analysis:**
  Connects to a specified webcam index (`camera_index` parameter in `/video_feed` route, defaults to 0).
  Continuously captures frames from the camera.
  Processes each frame through the detection and density analysis pipeline in near real-time.
  Streams the processed frames back to the web interface (`live.html`) using MJPEG streaming.
  Includes fallback logic to use a local video file (`videoplayback.mp4`) if the specified camera is not accessible, allowing testing without a physical webcam.

 \* **Server-Sent Events (SSE) for Live Status:**
  Provides a low-latency mechanism for the server (`app.py`) to push real-time updates on the analysis status and detected person count to the client (`live.html`).
  This avoids the need for the browser to repeatedly poll the server for updates, improving efficiency and responsiveness.
  The status updates include the overall risk level and the total number of persons detected in the current frame.

 \* **Media File Upload and Processing:**
  Supports uploading image (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.bmp`, etc.) and video files (`.mp4`, `.avi`, etc.) via the `/upload_media` route.
  Analyzes the entire video (frame by frame) or the single image.
  For videos, the system keeps track of the highest risk status encountered and saves an image of the frame corresponding to that highest status for display on the results page.
  The full processed video (with overlays on every frame) is also saved and made available for download.
  For images, the processed image with overlays is saved and displayed.

 \* **Mandatory Fluvio Data Streaming:**
  **Fluvio integration is a core requirement and is NOT optional.** Within the `process_media_content` function, after analyzing each frame (in both live stream and file upload modes), a structured JSON payload containing detailed analysis results is created.
  This payload includes vital information such as a timestamp, frame index, the complete density grid, the determined `frame_status`, the total `confirmed_persons`, and counts of `high_density_cells` and `critical_density_cells`.
  This JSON data is **automatically published asynchronously** to the configurable `FLUVIO_CROWD_TOPIC` (defaulting to `"crowd-data"`). The application will attempt to connect to Fluvio on startup and will continue to publish data if the connection is successful. If Fluvio is not running or accessible, the application will log errors but will continue local processing and web interface functionality (though the essential real-time data streaming feature to Fluvio will be inactive).

 \* **Essential Fluvio Consumer (`predict_stampede.py`):**
  This standalone Python script is provided as an **essential companion** to demonstrate how external applications *must* connect to Fluvio to access the real-time data stream generated by the web application.
  It connects to the Fluvio cluster, creates a `partition_consumer` for the `crowd-data` topic and partition 0, and streams records.
  It parses the incoming JSON messages and prints the key analysis details to the console.
  This script highlights the required method for downstream systems to consume the analysis data for advanced analysis, alerting, database storage, or integration with other platforms.

 \* **Informative Web Interface:**
  Designed with three main pages: `index.html` (home/upload), `live.html` (live stream), and `results.html` (uploaded media results).
  Utilizes responsive design principles (via CSS media queries) to provide a usable experience on different devices.
  Provides clear status messages, loading indicators, and visual displays of the processed media and analysis results.
  Includes an optional audio alert (`beep.mp3`) on the results page if a critical risk was detected in the uploaded media.

 \#\# Why Fluvio Integration is a Non-Negotiable Core Component

 The integration of Fluvio is not merely a feature; it is a fundamental element of this project's architecture, designed to ensure the system is scalable, reliable, and integrable into larger safety infrastructures. It moves the project beyond a simple visual tool to a data-streaming platform for crowd intelligence.

 Here's a deeper look at the indispensable role of Fluvio:

 1. **The Data Bus for Actionable Intelligence:** The primary output of the AI analysisâ€”the crowd density grid, person counts, and risk statusâ€”is time-sensitive and critical information. Fluvio serves as the required data bus to distribute this intelligence in real-time. Without Fluvio, this valuable data would largely be confined to the web interface, severely limiting its utility for automated responses, long-term monitoring, and integration with other security systems.
 2. **Enabling a Distributed Ecosystem:** Real-world crowd monitoring scenarios often involve multiple cameras, different types of sensors, and various downstream applications (alerting systems, dashboards, data lakes, historical analysis tools). Fluvio provides the necessary decoupled architecture. The Stampede Prediction app's role is to produce the analysis data; Fluvio's role is to make that data reliably available to *any* authorized consumer, anywhere in the network, in real-time. This distributed model is only possible with a streaming platform like Fluvio.
 3. **Scalability and Resilience are Paramount:** A safety-critical system needs to scale to handle data from potentially many sources and remain operational even if components fail. Fluvio is explicitly designed for high-throughput, low-latency streaming and offers features like partitioning and replication that are essential for handling increasing data volumes and ensuring the system remains available. Relying solely on the Flask application to directly manage data distribution would be a significant bottleneck and single point of failure in a real-world deployment.
 4. **Reliable Data Delivery Guarantees:** In a stampede scenario, losing data updates could be disastrous. Fluvio provides robust guarantees about message delivery and persistence. The data is stored reliably within the cluster, ensuring that downstream systems can receive and process *all* the critical updates, even if they experience temporary outages or slowdowns. This level of reliability is a non-negotiable requirement for safety applications.
 5. **Standardized Integration Point:** By mandating Fluvio as the data output layer, the project provides a standardized, well-defined interface for integrating with other systems. Any external application or service that needs to utilize the crowd prediction data simply needs a Fluvio client and the necessary topic permissions. This dramatically simplifies the process of building a comprehensive crowd safety solution involving multiple components.

 The `predict_stampede.py` script is provided not just as an example, but as a demonstration of the *required* method to access the core output data of this system. While the web interface offers a visual representation, the real power and intended use of this application lie in the real-time data stream published to Fluvio, ready to be consumed by other critical safety systems. **Therefore, a functional Fluvio cluster and the `crowd-data` topic are mandatory prerequisite infrastructure for this application.**

 \#\# Technical Deep Dive (Continued)

 Expanding further on the implementation details:

 \* **OpenCV for Media Handling:** OpenCV handles the low-level interaction with video and image files and streams. It provides the functions to capture frames from a camera (`cv2.VideoCapture`), read image files (`cv2.imread`), draw shapes (rectangles for overlays - `cv2.rectangle`), draw text (`cv2.putText`), manipulate image pixels (for background effects and overlays - `cv2.addWeighted`), and encode/decode images (`cv2.imencode`, `cv2.imwrite`). It's the bridge between the raw media and the processing logic.
 \* **YOLO with Ultralytics:** The choice of the `ultralytics` library simplifies the use of YOLO models. It handles loading the `.pt` weight file, managing the model architecture, and executing predictions (`yolo_model.predict`). It returns structured results that include bounding box coordinates, confidence scores, and class IDs, which are then easily extracted and processed using NumPy. The automatic model download feature of `ultralytics` makes initial setup significantly easier.
 \* **Density Grid Algorithm:** The algorithm iterates through the bounding boxes of detected persons. For each person, it calculates the approximate center point. This center point's coordinates are then used to determine which grid cell it falls into based on the frame's dimensions and the number of rows/columns. A 2D list (`density_grid`) is incremented at the corresponding cell's index. This provides a spatially distributed count of people.
 \* **Risk Status Mapping:** The `STATUS_HIERARCHY` dictionary assigns integer priorities to different status strings. This allows the `get_higher_priority_status` function to consistently determine which status represents a higher risk level when comparing statuses across frames (e.g., for a video analysis).
 \* **Web Streaming with MJPEG and SSE:**
  The `/video_feed` route uses MJPEG (Motion JPEG) streaming. It sets the `Content-Type` to `multipart/x-mixed-replace; boundary=frame`. The `generate_live_frames` generator function continuously captures processed frames, encodes them as JPEG images (`cv2.imencode('.jpg', ...)`), and yields them prefixed with the boundary and content type headers. The browser interprets this as a continuous stream of JPEG images, creating the appearance of video.
  The `/stream_status` route uses Server-Sent Events (SSE). It sets the `Content-Type` to `text/event-stream`. The `generate_status_updates` generator waits for a signal on the `status_update_queue` (indicating new data is available), retrieves the latest shared status data, formats it as an SSE message (`data: {json_payload}\n\n`), and yields it. The JavaScript on `live.html` uses the `EventSource` API to listen for these messages and update the displayed status and person count.
 \* **Fluvio SDK Usage:** The `fluvio` Python library is used to interact with the Fluvio cluster.
  In `app.py`, `Fluvio.connect()` establishes a connection. `fluvio_client.topic_producer(FLUVIO_CROWD_TOPIC)` creates a producer instance. `fluvio_producer.send(key_bytes, data_bytes)` publishes a message with a key and value.
  In `predict_stampede.py`, `Fluvio.connect()` establishes the connection. `fluvio_client.partition_consumer(topic, partition)` creates a consumer for a specific topic and partition. `consumer.stream(Offset.from_end(0))` creates a stream that will yield records starting from the latest message. The script then iterates through this stream (`for record in stream:`). `record.value_string()` retrieves the message payload as a string.
 \* **Thread Safety:** Given that Flask can handle multiple requests concurrently and the live stream uses generators potentially interacting with shared state, basic thread safety is implemented using `threading.Lock` (`live_status_lock`) when accessing or modifying the `live_status_data` dictionary. The `Queue` is also inherently thread-safe for signaling updates.

 This deeper dive provides insight into the specific libraries and techniques used to implement the application's features, highlighting the flow of data and control within the system and reinforcing the central role of Fluvio.

 \#\# Installation Guide

 This detailed guide provides instructions for setting up and running the Stampede Risk Prediction web application on Ubuntu and macOS, including setting up a Python environment, installing dependencies, and configuring Fluvio. **A functional Fluvio cluster and the necessary topic are prerequisites that MUST be completed before running the application.**

 **Prerequisites:**

 \* Python 3.7+
 \* `pip` (Python package installer)
 \* `git`
 \* **A running Fluvio cluster.** Follow the [official Fluvio installation guide](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.fluvio.io/docs/install/) for instructions specific to your operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows via WSL). Install the Fluvio CLI and ensure a cluster is running (e.g., using `fluvio cluster start` for a local cluster). **This step is mandatory.**

 \#\#\# Step 1: Clone the Repository

 Open your terminal application and clone the project repository from its GitHub URL:

 ` bash  git clone <repository_url> # Replace with the actual GitHub URL of the project  cd <repository_name> # Navigate into the cloned project directory   `

 Ensure you replace `<repository_url>` and `<repository_name>` with the actual details of your project's repository.

 \#\#\# Step 2: Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment

 Creating a virtual environment is essential to isolate the project's dependencies from your system's Python installation, preventing potential conflicts.

 **For Ubuntu:**

 ` bash  sudo apt update  sudo apt install python3-venv python3-dev build-essential # Install necessary packages if not already present  python3 -m venv venv # Create a virtual environment named 'venv' in the current directory  source venv/bin/activate # Activate the virtual environment   `

 **For macOS:**

 ` bash  python3 -m venv venv # Create a virtual environment named 'venv' in the current directory  source venv/bin/activate # Activate the virtual environment   `

 After activation, you should see the name of your virtual environment (e.g., `(venv)`) at the beginning of your terminal prompt. This confirms you are working within the isolated environment.

 \#\#\# Step 3: Install Project Dependencies

 With your Python virtual environment active, install the required Python libraries. These are listed in the `requirements.txt` file provided with the project.

 ` bash  pip install -r requirements.txt   `

 This command will download and install all the libraries needed by the project, including `Flask`, `opencv-python`, `ultralytics`, `fluvio`, `numpy`, etc.

 **Automatic YOLO Model Download:** The `ultralytics` library is configured in `app.py` to load a specific YOLO model file (`yolo11n.pt`). When you run `app.py` for the first time, if this model file is not found in the project directory, `ultralytics` will automatically download it for you. **You do not need to manually download the `.pt` model file yourself.**

 \#\#\# Step 4: Set up Fluvio Topic - REQUIRED

 **This step is mandatory as Fluvio integration is a core component of the application.**

 Ensure your Fluvio cluster is actively running. If you installed it locally, you can typically start it by running `fluvio cluster start` in a new terminal window (keep this running while using the application). If you are using a remote Fluvio cluster, ensure your Fluvio CLI is configured to connect to it correctly.

 The Stampede Risk Prediction application **requires** a specific Fluvio topic to publish its analysis data. The default topic name configured in `app.py` is `crowd-data`. You must create this topic before running the application or attempting to consume data from it.

 Create the topic using the Fluvio CLI:

 ` bash  fluvio topic create crowd-data   `

 You can verify that the topic was created successfully by listing the topics in your cluster:

 ` bash  fluvio topic list   `

 You should see `crowd-data` listed among the topics available in your Fluvio cluster.

 \#\#\# Step 5: (Optional) Place Fallback Video File

 The live stream feature (`live.html`) is configured to attempt to use a local webcam first (defaulting to camera index 0). As a convenience, the code includes a fallback mechanism: if no webcam is found or accessible, it will attempt to use a video file named `videoplayback.mp4` located in the project's root directory as the video source.

 If you do not have a webcam or prefer to test the live stream functionality using a pre-recorded video, place a suitable MP4 video file (e.g., a video of a crowd) named exactly `videoplayback.mp4` in the root directory of your cloned project (`<repository_name>/videoplayback.mp4`).

 \#\#\# Step 6: Run the Flask Web Application

 Now that your environment is set up, all dependencies installed, and your Fluvio cluster running with the `crowd-data` topic created, you can now start the main web application.

 Ensure your Python virtual environment is still active (check for `(venv)`) at the start of your terminal prompt.

 Run the `app.py` script:

 ` python  python app.py   `

 The console output will provide information about the application's startup process. This includes:
 \* Confirmation of the Flask development server starting.
 \* Messages related to the loading of the YOLO model. On the first run, this will involve automatically downloading the model file if it's not present.
 \* Information about the attempt to connect to your Fluvio cluster. If the connection is successful, you'll see confirmation that the Fluvio client and producer are ready. If the connection fails, you'll see error messages, but the application will still start (though the essential data streaming feature to Fluvio will be inactive until Fluvio is running and accessible).

 By default, the Flask application runs in debug mode on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Keep this terminal window open as long as you want the web application to be operational.

 \#\#\# Step 7: Run the Fluvio Consumer - ESSENTIAL

 To realize the full potential of this application and utilize the real-time crowd intelligence data, you **must** run a Fluvio consumer that subscribes to the `crowd-data` topic. The provided `predict_stampede.py` script serves as an essential example of how to do this and allows you to see the raw data stream.

 1. Open a **new**, separate terminal window.
 2. Navigate to your project directory.
 3. Activate the Python virtual environment in this new terminal. This is crucial so that the `fluvio` library is available:
  **For Ubuntu:**

 ` bash  cd <repository_name> # Navigate back to the project directory if needed  source venv/bin/activate   `

  **For macOS:**

 ` bash  cd <repository_name> # Navigate back to the project directory if needed  source venv/bin/activate   `
 4. Run the `predict_stampede.py` script:

 ` python  python predict_stampede.py   `

 This script will attempt to connect to your Fluvio cluster and create a consumer for the `crowd-data` topic on partition 0. Once connected, it will start listening for new messages published to this topic (specifically, it uses `Offset.from_end(0)` to only read messages that arrive *after* the consumer starts). As you use the "Analyze Uploaded Media" or "Start Live Webcam Feed" features in the web application, you will see the structured JSON data representing the crowd analysis results printed in the console of this terminal window in real-time. Keep this terminal open to continuously monitor the data stream. This script demonstrates the fundamental interaction pattern for any system wishing to consume the analysis output.

 \#\# Getting Started

 Once the Flask application (Step 6) and the Fluvio consumer (Step 7) are running, you can interact with the system:

 1. **Access the Application:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You will land on the home page (`index.html`).
 2. **Analyze an Uploaded File:**
  On the home page, find the "Or Upload Image or Video File:" section.
  Click the "Choose File" label.
  Select a video file (e.g., MP4, AVI) or an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG) from your computer.
  The selected file name will appear next to the "Choose File" button.
  Click the "Analyze Uploaded Media" button.
  The page will show a "Processing media..." loading message with a spinner.
  Once processing is complete (this may take significant time for large video files), you will be redirected to the results page (`results.html`).
  The results page will display the processed media (the most critical frame for videos, the processed image for images) with risk overlays, the overall risk status determined (e.g., "Normal", "CRITICAL RISK"), the maximum number of persons detected, and the processing time.
  If a critical risk was detected, a short "beep" sound may play (ensure your browser allows audio autoplay or interact with the page first to enable sound).
  For videos, a link to download the full processed video file will also be provided (if successfully generated).
  **Crucially, observe the terminal running `predict_stampede.py`.** You will see the JSON data for each processed frame of the uploaded media printed in this terminal, demonstrating that the analysis data is being streamed to Fluvio.
  Click the "Process another file or view live stream" link to return to the home page.
 3. **View the Live Webcam Feed:**
  On the home page, click the "Start Live Webcam Feed" button, or navigate directly to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/live`.
  The live analysis page (`live.html`) will load.
  If you have multiple cameras connected, use the "Select Camera:" dropdown to choose the camera index you wish to analyze. The video feed displayed will update accordingly.
  The page will display the real-time video feed from the selected source with dynamic overlays highlighting risky areas.
  Above the video feed, the "Stampede Chance:" status and "Detected Persons:" count will update live using Server-Sent Events (SSE) as each frame is processed.
  **Observe the terminal running `predict_stampede.py`.** You will see the continuous stream of JSON data being sent to Fluvio for every frame analyzed from the live feed. This is the core, real-time output of the system.
  Click the "â¬… Back to Upload Page" link to return to the home page.

 \#\# Configuration Details

 The following constants in `app.py` are crucial for configuring the application's behavior and analysis parameters. You may need to adjust these based on your environment, the characteristics of the crowds being monitored, and desired sensitivity.

 ` python  # --- Load Machine Learning Model ---  # MODEL_PATH = "yolo11n.pt" # Change this to 'yolov8s.pt', 'yolov8m.pt', 'yolov8l.pt' etc. if desired.  # The specified model will be automatically downloaded by ultralytics if not found locally.  MODEL_PATH = "yolo11n.pt" # Default: Lightweight and fast nano model   # ...   # --- Model Specific Settings ---  # For COCO dataset used by standard YOLO models, 'person' is usually class index 0  PERSON_CLASS_INDEX = 0  # Confidence threshold for YOLO detections (adjust as needed, lower is more detections but potentially more false positives)  # Default value based on testing  DETECTION_THRESHOLD = 0.02125   # --- Density Analysis Settings ---  # Number of persons in a grid cell to trigger 'High Density' status for that cell  HIGH_DENSITY_THRESHOLD = 5  # Number of persons in a grid cell to trigger 'Critical Density' status for that cell  CRITICAL_DENSITY_THRESHOLD = 8   # Number of High Density cells required to trigger 'High Density Warning' overall status  HIGH_DENSITY_CELL_COUNT_THRESHOLD = 3  # Number of Critical Density cells required to trigger 'CRITICAL RISK' overall status  CRITICAL_DENSITY_CELL_COUNT_THRESHOLD = 2   # Dimensions of the density analysis grid (adjust based on scene perspective and desired granularity)  GRID_ROWS = 8  GRID_COLS = 8  # ...   # --- Fluvio Settings ---  # The Fluvio topic to which analysis data is published.  # ENSURE this topic exists in your Fluvio cluster BEFORE running the app.  FLUVIO_CROWD_TOPIC = "crowd-data"  # In predict_stampede.py, FLUVIO_PARTITION defaults to 0  # ...   `

 After modifying any of these constants in `app.py`, you must restart the Flask web application (`python app.py`) for the changes to take effect.
